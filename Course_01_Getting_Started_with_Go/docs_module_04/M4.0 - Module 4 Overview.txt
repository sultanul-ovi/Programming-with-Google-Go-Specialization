[MUSIC] Welcome to Module 4. We're talking about protocols and
formats in this module, standardized protocols and formats. So the idea here is that
when you write code It is very common to want to interact with
other systems outside of your own code. And when I say interact,
I mean trade data, you get pass data to the other system,
it just passed the data back to you. This happens all the time,
maybe it's network, you're communicating with some
network server or something like that. Maybe you're just trading data files,
you have a database and it's in a particular format, you want to
give that to another piece of code, another system or you want to accept
a database format provided by something. So, in order to do this type of
communication interaction between different systems there
are many systems that exist. Standard communication protocols, standard
data formats that exist that allow you to communicate with other systems. HTML, JSON, there are a ton of them and
we'll talk about some of these. And has packages that handle, that allow
you to interface with these standards, not all of them but all the big ones. So HTML, there's a package just for
dealing with HTML, JSON has a package for that and so on. So we're going to talk about some of these
packages, and you'll be able to use them inside your code and
communicate with other bigger systems.
