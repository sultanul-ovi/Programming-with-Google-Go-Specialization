# Moore's Law: Is It Dead?

## What is Moore's Law?

Moore's Law is a prediction that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles very two years, based the limitation of the amount it can handle

## Moore's Law?

- many argue that the size of transistors is at its minimum because of the size of atoms.
- growing costs related to enevery, cooling and manufacturing
  - temperature increases as power increases
  - more power is needed as transistor density increases
- capacitance goes down and resistance goes up, making it difficult to perform calculations
  - tricky voltage scaling
    - reduces dynamic power consumption
    - can't prevent leakage power loss
    - limited due to noise or threshold voltage
