📚 _Notes & Certificates from the Coursera Specialization by University of California, Irvine_

> This repository documents my journey through the **Programming with Google Go Specialization** on Coursera. It includes course descriptions, certificates, and helpful learning resources.

## 📌 Specialization Overview

This intermediate-level, three-course specialization introduces the **Go (Golang)** programming language developed by Google. The series builds a strong foundation in Go’s syntax, functions, methods, interfaces, and concurrency models — preparing learners to build efficient, clean, and high-performance applications.
