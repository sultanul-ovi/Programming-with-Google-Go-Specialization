## 📌 [Specialization Overview](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang)

This intermediate-level, three-course specialization introduces the **Go (Golang)** programming language developed by Google. The series builds a strong foundation in Go’s syntax, functions, methods, interfaces, and concurrency models — preparing learners to build efficient, clean, and high-performance applications.

- 👨‍🏫 Instructor: Prof. Ian Harris (UC Irvine)
- 📹 Course Format: Video lectures, quizzes, and peer-reviewed assignments
- 🧑‍💻 Designed for learners with prior programming experience (C, Python, Java, etc.)
